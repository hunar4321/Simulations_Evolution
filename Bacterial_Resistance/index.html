	<h3> Demo of Bacterial Resistance </h3>
	<li> most antibiotics kill bacteria by affecting their membranes </li>
	<li> bacteria vary in their wall thickness, and hence, vary in their resistance to antibiotics </li>
	<li> use left mouse click to adminster antibiotics </li>
	<li> use space-bar to simulate bacterial re-generation </li>
	<li> adminster antibiotics and follow it by re-generation. Do that repeatedly and see how bacterial resistances emerges as the antibiotic kills the weaker bacteria letting the stronger bacteria (those with thicker walls) re-generate</li>
